At the end of this message, I will ask you to do something.
Please follow the "Explore, Plan, Code, Report" workflow when you start.
# Explore
First, use parallel subagents to find and read all files that may be useful for implementing the requested functionality, either as examples or as edit targets. The subagents should return relevant file paths, and any other info that may be useful.
# Plan
Next, think hard and write up a detailed implementation plan. Use your judgement as to what is necessary, given the standards of this repo.
If there are things you are not sure about, use parallel subagents to do some web research. They should only return useful information, no noise.
If there are things you still do not understand or questions you have for the user, pause here to ask them before continuing.
# Code
When you have a thorough implementation plan, you are ready to start writing code. Use context7 to get the latest documentation on any package or library that you are working with. Follow the style of the existing codebase.
# Write up your work
When you are happy with your work, write up a short report. Include what you set out to do, and the choices you made with their brief justification.
